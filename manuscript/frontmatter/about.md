# About the Companion

This book is intended as a companion to my [Whats new in Java 8](https://www.udemy.com/whats-new-in-java-8) course available on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/whats-new-in-java-8).

However, you don't have to watch the online course to make the most of this book. It's an independent read and  contains all the examples from the course so you don't need to have watch the course.

The book will help you get to grips with the new features of Java 8; lambdas and their impact as well as the new APIs and behind-the-scenes changes.
