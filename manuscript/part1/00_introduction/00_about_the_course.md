# Introduction

Welcome to my course on What's new in Java 8.

The course is split into two parts which you can buy separately from [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/whats-new-in-java-8).

Part 1 is all about lambdas; their background, how Java's had to change to support them, their syntax, technicalities and usage. In Part 2, we have a good look at the rest of the new features and the API changes.


## Delivery

In terms of how I deliver the course. For each section, there's a mixture of slides and demos. I try and keep the slides entertaining so you won't see slide after slide of boring bullet points. What you will see should lead nicely into into the live demos.

The demos are where we'll go over most of the syntax. I want this to feel like a pairing session, so you'll see me code and we'll talk over what I'm doing.


## What you can expect?

After watching Part 1, you'll know pretty much all you need to know about lambdas. I talk about the lambdas in-depth so you'll be well equipped to make your code more concise as you move towards Java 8.

Part 2 covers pretty much all of the remaining. You'll get a good feel for what's available and for the big features, we'll explore things in as much detail as possible.

We'll question when these things are really useful and try and show practical examples along the way.
